<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Hi, I am Ryan Lam, a rising senior at Abraham Lincoln High School. I have joined E1T1 in hopes of exploring new career fields and improving my skillsets. A little about myself; my favorite subject is mathematics because I love to calculate and solve real world problems. I hope I can learn the highest level of math some day! Also, I have many hobbies outside of school. My favorite is martial arts, which I have been doing for 12 years and am currently a black belt second degree. I have also picked up boxing recently and really enjoy it. I workout and play basketball with my friends which help relieve stress. From my hobbies, I have learned the importance of hard work and discipline which guide me through all areas of my life. I want to continue to carry this through my future endeavors and be successful!</p>
